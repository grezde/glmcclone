## IDEAS

- Biome with a giant tree in the center, like the swamp in Avatar.
- Tools have qualities from Literally unplayable, Atrocious, Very bad, Bad, medium, good, very good, perfect.
- Ruined cities deep underground
- Essence ocean, with vines that look similar to strads of RNA
- Infinite depth, but at 2000 blocks you reach a chasm that takes you to sort of another dimention
- Other planets.
- Small trees, large trees, many axe hits to chot even the smaller tree

## Lore ideas

All celestial bodies in the solar system are alive. In some roman ruins there are murals protraying a black and white snake
eating eachother oroboros-style, with a green round glowing object in the middle. The white snake is the sun and the black snake
is the moon. The green center symbolises Gea, the mother. A big event is the solar eclipse, in which the black snake engulfs the white snake. All non-rl gems shine, the mural portrays the white snake dissapearing, an there is camera shake + earthquake sounds, but with an added weird doorcreak sfx + animals act wildly. 

- deep underground futuristic ancient cities / research facilities made of copper iron and containing steampunk and gem technology
- deep underground small-ish altars made with concrete sculpted pillars and a single coocon at the center
- roman cities
- chinese palace maybe
- Tenochtitlan maybe

The roman ruins contain different murals protraying a green mother with 2 children, a married black and white
couple with a green child. an orange child with a sword battling the two snakes (similar to hercules).  a large mural of the orange man killing Gea and the two snakes then trying to kill him. a mural of sick people. A menacing green woman with a spear with people praying to her. A green woman sacrificing an orange lamb.  +other non lore related

The alchemy city contains murals with the oroboros snake and green center  lens-flare ball.  a map of the solar system with the sun, moon, Gea and an orange planet at the L3 point. a woman in yellow bridal clothes levitating in meditating position with the sun and moon above her, with green hands extending from the ground pulling her back. Person with third eye opened. calculations. dna mechanism chart. two snakes coiling like dna and a green cart going above them. +other non lore related

The plyer first spawns out a dark green coocoon, and is the only one in the world. Below 2048 depth, there is a dark sea that you instantly die in unless you bring  specific gem with you. If you go into the essence sea, there are green tendrils all over the place,
floating. There are also 2 types of white cell - like monsters that attack you. There are monsters that walk on the tendrils and create new tendrils. There are monsters that eat the tendrils and produce dna carrier monsters. There are some monsters that simply go up and down, carrying things. There are some monsters that take things from the matter carriers and dna carriers and produce new monsters. This goes on for 1024 blocks down. During the eclipse, the monsters all stop and glow.
